# WeatherApp
Very simple weather app that uses API from: https://openweathermap.org/api

This is my first android project. I developed it during summer vacation (before my last year of the degree).
The project uses the following skills: 
*Correct OOP
*Working with JSON. 
*Getting data from web (external source). 
*Working with Threads. 
*File creation, saving/loading data to it or from it. 
*Simple UI Layout + using an adapter.
